A short description of the project's name and what it does. This may be taken from your design docs.

“The Circle of Life”, is an engaging Python game that follows the life journey of a baby bird through 3 different levels, representing its different stages in life. The journey begins with the bird as a baby, navigating its way in a vibrant forest, overcoming obstacles, and collecting seeds to grow. In the first two levels of the game, the bird adapts and learns to avoid obstacles by jumping and double jumping as a way of moving. With each level, the intensity increases. In level 2, there are two obstacles that now appear. As the player reaches the final stage, level 3, the bird is finally able to fly and introduces a different way for the player to engage with the obstacles and seed collection. The game starts with the bird starting as a baby and through each level it undergoes a change in appearance and powerups, symbolizing the circle of life. 

How to run the project. For example, which file the user should run in an editor. If your project uses data/source files, also describe how the user should set those up.

The python file must be located in the same location as the image files. The python file next has to be opened in and run with cmu_graphics package installed in an IDE like VSCode. 

Which libraries you're using that need to be installed, if any. If you can include the library in the submission, that is preferred.

- Just using cmu_graphics	

A list of any shortcut commands that exist. Shortcut commands can be used to demonstrate specific features by skipping forward in a game or loading sample data. They're useful for when you're testing your code too!

- No shortcuts as such but pause button, reset button, q button for quit

Update: Which fonts you're using that need to be installed, if any. These fonts should be listed by their specific name. This includes any custom fonts or fonts that may not be downloaded on users' files. If you can include the installation file (.ttf or .otf) in the submission, that is preferred.
